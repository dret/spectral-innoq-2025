# Spectral-Themed INNOQ Technology Lunch 2025

These are the examples for the "API Linting with Spectral" workshop held at the [INNOQ Technology Lunch](https://www.innoq.com/de/technology-lunch/) on March 5th, 2025.

In order for this to work as demonstrated (the commands used in the workshop are listed in `commands.md`) you need to copy (or move) `pre-commit` to the `.git/hooks/` directory of your clone or fork.

The presentation slides [are available online at `dret.net/lectures/innoq-tech-lunch-2025/`](http://dret.net/lectures/innoq-tech-lunch-2025/).
